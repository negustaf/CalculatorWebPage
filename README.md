# Calculator Web Page
A basic calculator website I made in high school with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays its memory of your calculation history.

## Pseudo code
### 1. HTML/CSS
</br>
```
Input is by buttons - with specific value - appends to a string
```
	```
	Divs specific IDs
	```
	
2. JavaScript functions
	Must hit clear to start over
		Clear would also create empty string
	Converting string into array for functions
	Equal
		Finish the calculation
		Stores calculation to last 5 section - ascending order
		Put calculation into Order of Operations
		Value at the top is replaced with answer
		
	Take calculation add it into Order of Operations
	Order of Operations calls functions to solve problem
	Answer at bottom gets concatenated with original equation with answer
